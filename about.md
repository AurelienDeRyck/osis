OSIS (Open Student Information System) is a lightweight and yet highly scalable system to manage the core business of higher education institutions. It is free and [open source](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-louvain) under the terms of [GPL v3 public license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), aligned with the strong spirit of knowledge sharing and collaboration of the community. The project is funded by [Universit√© catholique de Louvain](http://uclouvain.be/index.html) in the context of its long term goal of modernizing its information systems towards the next generation of students, devices, practices and technologies.

By using OSIS, a higher education institution is able to maintain, control and monitor the entire student's career, from the adimission to the diploma and all information orbiting this fundamental process, such as planning the academic year, managing partnerships with other institutions for exchange and mobility programs, assigning teachers to courses and courses to students, etc. At the current stage, OSIS is designed to fulfill UCL's needs, but it can be properly adapted to fulfill more needs coming from other institutions interested in joining the project.
