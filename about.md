OSIS (Open Student Information System) is a lightweight and yet highly scalable
system to manage the core business of higher education institutions. It is free
and [open source](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis) under the terms of [GPL v3
public license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), aligned with the
strong spirit of knowledge sharing and collaboration of the community. The
project is funded by [Universit√© catholique de Louvain](http://uclouvain.be/index.html)
in the context of its long term goal of modernizing its information systems
towards the next generation of students, devices, practices and technologies.

By using OSIS, a higher education institution is able to maintain, control and
monitor the entire student's career, from the admission to the diploma and all
information orbiting this fundamental process, such as planning the academic
year, managing partnerships with other institutions for exchange and mobility
programs, assigning teachers to courses and courses to students, etc. At the
current stage, OSIS is designed to fulfill UCL's needs, but it can be properly
adapted to fulfill more needs coming from other institutions interested in
joining the project.

Offering a reusable system is not the only advantage of being open source. It
also means:

- fully transparent operations for the entire academic community;
- inspiration for entrepreneurs to build integrated services that may be, at
  some point, incorporated into OSIS;
- empowering departments, endowed with the necessary expertise, to develop
  extensions to fulfill their particular needs;
- opportunity for students looking for a job, but with no previous experience,
  to participate in a real world project;
- reduced maintenance cost for the University thanks to the range of reliable
  open source products required by the system, such as the web server
  [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org), the database
  [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) and the web framework
  [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com).

This website aims to keep you informed about the evolution of OSIS and share the
knowledge acquired during the course of the project. Please, don't hesitate to

any question.
