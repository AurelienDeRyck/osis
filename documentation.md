In the OSIS project, the largest part of the documentation is produced even
before the development of the features starts. The philosophy of documenting
first and developing later is inspired on
[Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
(TDD) principles, where tests are created before the features. To enable that,
we ask analysts and programmers to write requirements, processes, procedures and
rules in the format of a user manual.

We value writing as a tool of knowledge sharing and we discourage volatile
knowledge, registered exclusively in informal formats such as post-its, emails,
and white boards. Documentation is so important for us that we treat it the same
way we do with the source code of the product: consistent version control,
iterations, releases, compilation, etc.

We document how the software was designed to be used, which translates into a
user manual; how developers should install and configure tools, platforms and
libraries to get OSIS up and running; and how data are represented,
classified, managed and explored. The documentation is available in the
following links:

If you use OSIS and found something undocumented, do not hesitate to [create
an issue](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-louvain/issues/new) or even try
documenting it yourself as a form of contributing to the project. You can also
translate it to your native language. The documentation is written in
[Asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/), specifically in the
[Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/) dialect. We use [Atom](https://atom.io)
as text editor with the
[Asciidoctor preview plugin](https://atom.io/packages/asciidoc-preview).
