The roadmap describes the content of each release, projects the upcoming
releases in the calendar and describes what they may contain. It's both,
a changelog and a planning at the same time.

This roadmap follows the conventions of [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com).
Please, read it first if you are going to maintain these roadmaps. No need for
users to read that because the conventions clearly state that the content
should be user-friendly.

Here you can find the roadmaps of all OSIS' repositories:
the backoffice ([OSIS](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis)),
the frontoffice ([OSIS-Portal](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-portal)) and
the shared code between them ([OSIS-Common](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-common)).

- [OSIS](/osis/roadmap/osis/) - 0.15.0
- [OSIS-Portal](/osis/roadmap/osis_portal/) - 0.4.0
- [OSIS-Common](/osis/roadmap/osis_common/) - 0.9.0

OSIS uses Semantic Versioning to rule the version numbers. Please, read the
documentation at [semver.org](http://semver.org) to understand why the numbers
are like that.

OSIS is currently used in production but its versions starts with 0 because it
isn't yet fulfilling all the needs of the institution. When it meets all the
functionalities to fully run a higer education institution then the project may
reach its final milestone, represented by the business-stable version 1.0.0. It
also marks the beginning of the maintenance phase, in which the first
subsequent version will be 1.1.0.
