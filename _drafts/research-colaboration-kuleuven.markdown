OSIS is a huge software project, planned to run during many years until
reaching its final goal. With size comes complexity, which requires inovative
management techniques to keep everything on track and at high quality. That's
why an important branch of this project is the definition, execution and
monitoring of the process to run itself.

Right up on the edge of the state of the art, we have been collaborating with
professor Yves Wautelet, from [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/about/), to
explore some inovations identified in our development process.
