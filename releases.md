Major releases of OSIS come out every 2 weeks, with minor releases comming out
on demand to apply patches to urgent issues. The content of the releases follow
the conventions of [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com). Please, read
it first if you are going to help on maintaining the release notes.

Here you can find the release notes of all OSIS' repositories:
 - backoffice ([OSIS](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis/releases)),
 - frontoffice ([OSIS-Portal](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-portal/releases)) and
 - common library ([OSIS-Common](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-common/releases)).

OSIS uses Semantic Versioning to rule version numbers. Please, read the
documentation at [semver.org](http://semver.org) to understand why the numbers
are like that.

OSIS is currently used in production but its versions starts with 0 because it
isn't yet fulfilling all the needs of the institution. When it meets all the
functionalities to fully run a higer education institution then the project may
reach its final milestone, represented by the business-stable version 1.0.0. It
also marks the beginning of the maintenance phase, in which the first
subsequent version will be 1.1.0.
