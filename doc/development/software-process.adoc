== Introduction

=== Communication

OSIS is an open source software sponsored by Université catholique de Louvain. For being open source, the communication strategy changes from the traditional internal communication to a global and transparent one. People should consider not only the participation of the internal team, but also developers and users all around the world. Therefore, to allow global and transparent communication, we have to comply with the following rules:

 1. Communication directed to the local community can be done in English or in the native language.
 2. Communication directed to the global community should be done in English only.
 3. The code should be written in English only.
 4. The user interface is multilingual but it will initially support English and French. The support for additional languages depends on the adoption of the software and the contributions from the community.
 5. Since there is not private source, all the communication is done using public channels such as mailing lists, chats, wikis and others.
 6. To be taken into account, a communication should be registered textually and preserved historically. Direct email communication between two or a subset of the team is not considered valid because all stakeholders should be equally informed.

To support the communication rules, we have created the following channels:

The team that maintains the context-free module communicates through the chat
https://gitter.im/uclouvain/OSIS in English only.

The team that discusses the context-specific module communicates through the chat
https://gitter.im/uclouvain/OSIS-Louvain in English or in French, the local native language.

The development community communicates through the group
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/osis-dev in English only.

The users community communicates through the group
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/osis-user in English or in French.

News about the project can be found at: http://uclouvain.github.io/OSIS/.

Development statistics about the project can be found at
https://www.openhub.net/p/OSIS.

Organizations that support the development of OSIS through a context-specific module can follow their own internal rules of communication.

=== Macro-processes

Our software methodology is composed of 4 macro-processes:

- *Analysis*: Iterative requirements gathering, analysis and documentation. The work of analysis is in itself iterative. The detachment from the rest of the process allows a level of freedom to run faster than the development process

- *Development*:
- *Test*:
- *Support*:

== Analysis

image::images/analysis.png[Analyse]

=== Report a business need
=== Create request of need
=== Verify the impact on existing business processes
=== Modify the impacted business processes
=== Request the creation of a new business process
=== Create a new business process
=== Review business process
=== Describe the execution of the process

During this activity, analysts are actually writing the user manual.

=== Review the execution of the process
=== Verify technical feasibility

== Development

image::images/development.png[Development]

=== Create work breakdown structure
=== Create requests for change
=== Demand developers estimations
=== Estimate requests
=== Distribute requests in upcoming iterations
=== Review project schedule
=== Inform user
=== Start upcoming iteration
=== Develop requests for change
=== Create automated tests for change
=== Release QA version

== Test

image::images/test.png[Test]

=== Execute all tests
=== Create request for fix
=== Fix based on failing test
=== Update user manual
=== Authorize release in production
=== Release in production
=== Inform user

== Support

image::images/support.png[Support]

=== Report application issue
=== Create reproduction test script
=== Create request for fix
=== Prioritize and allocate request
=== Fix based on failing test
=== Execute all tests
=== Authorize release on production
=== Release in production
=== Inform user

[glossary]
== Glossary

Atom:: A very simple text editor to be used on the writing of the user manual and on the development of the applications.

Context-free module:: A module that unifies the domain of higher education but doesn't consider the context where it is applied.

Context-specific module:: A module that inherits the domain from the context-free module and implement context's needs based on the local culture, law enforcements, integration with local systems and so on.

Git:: A distributed version control system.
GitHub::
Odoo::
Planner::
Python::
Runbot::
Selenium::
Visual Paradigm::
