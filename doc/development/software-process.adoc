== Introduction

=== Communication

OSIS is funded by UCLouvain, but it has an international visibility. The communication should consider not only the participation of the internal team, but also developers and users all around the world. The following channels were created to put the community in contact, preserving the history of communication.

The team that maintains the context-free module communicates through the chat: +
https://gitter.im/uclouvain/OSIS

The team that discusses the context-expecific module communicates through the chat: +
https://gitter.im/uclouvain/OSIS-Louvain

The development community communicates through the group: +
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/osis-dev

The users community communicates through the group: +
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/osis-user

=== Overview

Our software methodology is composed of 4 macro-processes:

- *Analysis*: Iterative requirements gathering, analysis and documentation. The work of analysis is in itself iterative. The detachment from the rest of the process allows a level of freedom to run faster than the development process

- *Development*:
- *Test*:
- *Support*:

== Analysis

image::images/analysis.png[Analyse]

=== Report a business need
=== Create request of need
=== Verify the impact on existing business processes

=== Request the creation of a new business process
=== Create a new business process
=== Review business process
=== Describe the execution of the process

During this activity, analysts are actually writing the user manual.

=== Review the execution of the process
=== Verify technical feasibility
