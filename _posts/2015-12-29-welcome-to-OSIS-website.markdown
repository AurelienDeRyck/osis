Welcome to OSIS Project website. Its goal is to inform you about the evolution
of the project, share the business and technical knowledge we have gathered,
motivate institutions to use OSIS and recognize all the priceless contributions
of the community.

OSIS stands for Open Student Information System. It's an application designed to
manage the core business of higher education institutions, such as universities,
faculties, institutes and professional schools. The core business involves the
administration of students, teachers, courses, programs and so on.

The project to build OSIS is entirely funded by the
[Universit√© catholique de Louvain](http://uclouvain.be) with the initial goal of
modernizing all its core business processes towards administrative
simplification and optimization. This goal is planned to be achieved by
September 2017. Until then OSIS will gradually replace the legacy systems,
module by module, feature by feature, in an agile effort to deliver incremental
releases every two weeks, with the first release programmed to January 18th.

If you are part of an educational institution we invite you to keep track of
OSIS. Eventually, you may find an opportunity to adopt it in your institution
and then we would sum up our efforts to make OSIS even better.

In the following posts we are going to explain the technology behind it, how we
solved the synchronization of the legacy database with the entirely new data
model, present the core team, our methodology in practice, and so on. Meanwhile,
you may join our mailing lists
([developers](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!aboutgroup/osis-dev) and
