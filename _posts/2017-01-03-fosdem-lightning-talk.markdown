We are happy to share with you the news we received today: our proposal to
present OSIS at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2017/about/) was accepted! That's
the first time we present the project to the Open Source community, fortunately,
in the most important free software conference in Europe.

We are going to present our [experience on the development of OSIS at Université
catholique de Louvain](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/open_student_info_system/)
(UCL). The presentation will take place in [room H.2215, Ferrer (H) building at
the ULB Solbosch Campus in Brussels](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/buildings/#h),
on Sunday, February 5th at 13h40.

We intend to share with the community the joy of building OSIS, the transition
from proprietary to open source, the cultural and technical shift, the
engagement of students, teachers and employees on the improvement of their own
user experience, the costs implied and the productivity gains.

For us, offering a reusable system is not the only advantage of being open
source. It also means:

* fully transparent operations for the entire academic community;
* inspiration for entrepreneurs to build integrated services to improve students
  academic experience;
* empower departments, endowed with the necessary expertise, to fulfill their
  particular needs by extending OSIS;
* build up students' experience on real world projects to boost their chances
  when applying for a job; and
* reduced maintenance cost for the University thanks to the range of reliable
  open source products required by the application.

But the path to open source was not simple. It required lots of discussions to
finally find a realistic long term formula to meet the institution's major
goals. Now that it is our reality, this history cannot be kept aside, but shared
with FOSDEM's community. We are going to answer the following questions during
the presentation:

* Why we are sharing our core business applications before any other higher
  education institution.
* How the academic community persuaded us to use Python/Django/PostgreSQL
  instead of JavaEE.
* How we are adapting to this new reality that requires much more discipline and
  high quality craftsmanship work.
* Why there is no doubt we will succeed in this entrepreneurship.
* Why we need your help to better manage and write this open source software.

The presentation will be given by [Hildeberto Mendonça](http://www.hildeberto.com),
who is leading the team of developers at UCL. Hildeberto has a Ph.D in applied
sciences and has been in the software development industry since 1998.

We have been participating as attendees over the years and we are glad to speak
this time. The friendly and intellectual mindset of the community is a great
source of motivation for free software users and contributors. We expect an
active and challenging audience to push our ideas further and eventually gain
more contributors and adopters. Looking forward to meet you there.
