I'm following good practices because:

- [ ] My pull request contains only well formatted code, using 4 spaces for identation.
- [ ] I am not abreviating classes, methods or function names.
- [ ] My code seems readable for me and my coleagues because I care about their effort to maintain my contributions in the future.

User Interface:

- [ ] Every section I have added is represented by and icon and described by a text.
- [ ] Every button I have added contains at least an icon + rint or icon + text.
