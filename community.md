Every software community starts with a core team, whose members were the first
ones to believe in the project. This is a major part of the team that is
responsible for making OSIS available to you. They give their best to make your
higher education institution run smoothly.

There are many ways to get involved:

 - **Sign-in in our mailing lists**: we have created one for
   [users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!aboutgroup/osis-user) to
   discuss features, ask questions, give suggestions, etc.; and another one for
   [developers](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!aboutgroup/osis-dev) to
   discuss how to develop new features, test existing ones, install and
   configure the application, etc.
 - **Talk directly to the team**: we have a chat available for those who want to
   talk directly to a member of the team. This is the fastest way to get your
   questions answered. [![Join the chat at  https://gitter.im/uclouvain/OSIS-Louvain](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/uclouvain/OSIS-Louvain?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
 - **Contribute with code, design and documentation**: There are many ways to
   contribute. The main ones are solving
   [issues](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis/issues) by writing code, improving
   the user interface design and usability, and documenting how the application
   works. Learn more about
   [contributing to the project](http://uclouvain.github.io/osis/contribute/).
 - **Report issues every time you find one**: when you find an opportunity to
   improve OSIS the best thing to do is to
   [create an issue](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis/issues/new) in our
   [issue tracking](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis/issues). The fastest way
   to get your issue done is discussing it with the project leader, try to solve
   it yourself and send a pull request. Or you can simply wait for the community
   to do it for you in the future.
 - **Follow OSIS on Twitter**: visit our
   [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/osis_louvain) and follow the updates.
 - **Join the team**: sometimes we open development positions to reinforce the
   team. You can find available positions at
   [UCL's website](http://uclouvain.be/emploi-offres.html). We also
   [tweet](https://twitter.com/osis_louvain) about available positions as soon
   as they become available. Stay tuned!
